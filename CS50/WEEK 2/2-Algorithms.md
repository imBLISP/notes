####Asemptotic notation:

> $O$ : Worst case runtime
> $\Omega$ : Best case runtime

####Algorithms:

| Algorithm name | Basic concept                                                | $O$       | $\Omega $  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Selection Sort | find the ==Smallest== unsorted element in an array and swap it with the ==first== unsorted element of that array | $n^2 $    | $n^2  $    |
| Bubble Sort    | ==swap adjacent pairs== of elements if they are out of order, effectively "bubbling" larger elements to the right and smaller ones to the left | $n^2   $  | $n$        |
| Insertion Sort | Proceed ==once== through the array from left-to-right, ==shifting== elements as necessary to insert each element into its correct place. | $n^2$     | $n$        |
| Merge Sort     | ==split== the full array into subarrays, then ==merge== those subarrays back together in the correct order. | $n\log n$ | $n \log n$ |
| Linear Search  | ==Iterate== across the array from left-to-right, trying to find the target element. | $n$       | $1$        |
| Binary Search  | Given a sorted array, ==devide and conquer== by systematically eliminating half of the remaining elements in the search for the target element. | $\log n$  | $1$        |
