# FUNCTIONS

---

#### Syntax:

```c
return_type name(argument_list)
{
	//return something;
}
```

 Ex:

```c
int main(void)
{
    //return something;
}
```

#### Functions Declaration:

###### Syntax:

`return-type name(argument-list);`

- The return type is what kind of variable the function will output.
- The name is what you want to call your function.
- The argument-list is the comma-seperated set of inputs to your function, each of
    which has a type and a name.

###### Information on declaration:

- first step to creating a  function is to declare it. this gives the compiler a heads up that a user written function appears in the code.

- Function declarations should always go atop your code, before you begin writing main().

- There is a standard form that every function declaration follows.

#### Calling a Function:

###### Syntax:

`name(argument_list);`

#### Properties:

1. functions are also known as procedures, methods, or subroutines.
2. functions is a black box with a set of ==0+ inputs and 1 output==.
3. behavior is predictable based on the name of the function.
4. why use functions? organization, simplification, reusability
