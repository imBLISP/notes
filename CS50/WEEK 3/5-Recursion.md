# RECURSION

---

- We might describe an implementation of an algorithm  as being particularly "elegant" if it solves a problem in a way that is both interesting and easy to visualize.

- The technique of **recursion** is a very common way to implement such "elegant" solution.

- ==The definition of a recursive function is one that, as part of its execution, invokes itself.==

- The factorial function `(n!)` is defined over all positive integers.

- `n!` equals all of the positive integers less than or equal to `n`, multiplied together.

- Thinking in terms of programming, we'll define the mathematical function `n!` as `fact(n)`.

    ```Â 
    fact(1) = 1
    fact(2) = 2 * 1
    fact(3) = 3 * 2 * 1
    fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    fact(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    .
    .
    ```

    This is equal to:

    ```
    fact(1) = 1
    fact(2) = 2 * fact(1)
    fact(3) = 3 * fact(2)
    fact(4) = 4 * fact(3)
    fact(5) = 5 * fact(4)
    .
    .
    ```

    This equals to:

    ```
    fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)
    ```

- This forms the basis for a **recursive definition** of the factorial function.

- Every recursive function has two cases that could apply, given any input.

    - The base case, which when triggered will terminate the recursive process.
    - The recursive case, which is where the recursion will actually occur.

    ```c
    int fact(int n)
    {
        // base case
        if (n == 1)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        // recursive case
        else
        {
            return n * fact(n-1);
        }
    }
    
    or
    
    int fact(int n)
    {
        if(n == 1)
            return 1;
        else
            return n * fact(n-1);
    }
    ```

- In general, but not always, recursive functions replace loops in non-recursive functions.
    ==Recursive Function==:

    ```c
    int fact(int n)
    {
        if (n == 1)
            return1;
        else
            return n * fact(n-1);
    }
    ```

    Replaces ==Iterative Function==:

    ```c
    int fact2(int n)
    {
        int product = 1;
        while(n > 0)
        {
            product *= n;
            n--;
        }
        return product;
    }
    ```

- It's also possible to have more than one base or recursive case, if the programming might recurse or terminate in different ways, depending on the input being passed in.

- **Multiple base cases**: The Fibonacci number sequence is defined as follows:

    - The first element is `0`.
    - The second element is `1`.
    - The $n$ th element is the sum of the $(n-1)$th and $(n-2)$th elements.

- **Multiple recursive cases**: The Collatz conjecture.

- The Collatz Conjecture is applies to positive integers and speculates that it is always possible to get "back to 1" if you follow these steps:

    - If $n$ is 1, stop.
    - Otherwise, if $n$ is even, repeat this process on $n/2$.
    - Otherwise, if $n$ is odd, repeat this process on $3n + 1$.

- Write a recursive function `collatz(n)` that calculates how many steps it takes to get to 1 if you start from n and recurse as indicated above.

    ```c
    int collatz(n)
    {
        int steps = 0;
        
        // base case
        if (n == 1)
            return steps;
        
        // recursive cases
        
        // even numbers
        if (n % 2 == 0)
            return 1 + collatz(n/2);
        // odd numbers
        else
            return 1 + collatz(3*n + 1);
    }
    ```
